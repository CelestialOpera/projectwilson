 FRA_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "The Great War saw the return of Alsace-Lorraine to the rightful owners of France but the Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau felt that he was pushed aside during the drafting and signing of the Post-War treaties by President Wilson in the United States. Clemenceau discreetly had propaganda published which inadvertedly lead to the rise of a new nationalist movement in France much like in Hungary. Rise of New Nationalists lead to a left wing government in the late 20s that eventually lost to the now ruling National Bloc attempting to quell radicals while also preparing for whats to come."
