 SOV_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "Born in the crucible of Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic now rules over Western Russia, as well as Byelorussia and the easternmost regions of Ukraine. Ruled since its inception by an alliance of far-left forces from urban Bolsheviks to rural Narodniks, the RSFSR is under the leadership of the revolutionary exemplar, Vladimir Lenin. Their Socialist experiment, however, is tempered by disagreements over the pace of collectivisation, as well as the current mono-cultural state of the republic. As Lenin appears to be in the winter of his life, the future of Soviet Socialism appears to be increasingly open to revision."

 #Events
 soviet.1.t:0 "Vladimir Lenin Passes Away"
 soviet.1.d:0 "An era ended in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic when the news of Vladimir Lenin's demise landed. Although this turn of events had been expected for long, as Lenin's declining health was far from a state secret, it still came as a shock that the leader of the Revolution for 18 years passed away. By the time the Pravda special edition hit the street, half the RSFSR had already heard the news. Peacefully passing away in his sleep, Lenin was surrounded by his friends and family at the time of his death. Succeeding the deceased revolutionary is his deputy, Alexei Rykov, although he will merely be an interim leader as the Soviet constitution calls for fresh elections within three months of the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars passing away. For now, however, the RSFSR will bid its goodbyes with the man who has led it ever since the fall of the Tsars."
 soviet.1.o1:0 "We will finish what you started."
 soviet.2.t:0 "Funeral of Vladimir Lenin"
 soviet.2.d:0 "In a grand ceremony with an attendance in the millions, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic paid its farewells to Vladimir Lenin. In accordance with his last wishes, he was buried next to his mother in the city of Narodnodar. Speaking at his funeral was his widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, as well as leading Bolsheviks such as interim Chairman Alexei Rykov and RKP General Secretary Leon Trotsky, but surprisingly also his former rival turned friend, Julius Martov, who mourned the death of a man he 'did not always agree with, but respected deeply'. The funeral was also attended by foreign dignitaries from most worldwide Communist Parties, and dignitaries from the other Socialist states of the world, and even a few representatives from the capitalist world. And with that, the world said goodbye to the most prominent revolutionary of its age."
 soviet.2.o1:0 "Farewell, father of the revolution."
 soviet.3.t:0 "Election of the Soviets Called"
 soviet.3.d:0 "In accordance with the Soviet Constitution of 1928, the All-Union Central Executive has dissolved the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, opening the way for new elections. With that, the peoples of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic are going to the polls to elect not just the Congress of Soviets, but also the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars to succeed the deceased Vladimir Lenin. Already, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries alike are agitating in local soviets, hoping to convince them to vote for their parties. Although the Bolsheviks are presenting a unified image outwards as always, it is clear from the multiple contradictory articles in Pravda that a ferocious struggle for power is taking place within the Russian Communist Party, one that is unlikely to be settled before the election is over. As such, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are already on the prowl, hoping to gain themselves a majority in the Congress of Soviets."
 soviet.3.o1:0 "Socialist democracy renews itself again and again"
 soviet.4.t:0 "Mensheviks and Left-SRs Form Electoral Coalition"
 soviet.4.d:0 "Despite the wedges in the Bolshevik Party, their advantage in the urban Soviets still appears too significant for the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to overcome by themselves. The parties have not been blind to this truth, and as such, on the initiative of Menshevik leader Julius Martov, the two parties have managed to form an electoral coalition, agreeing to not contest Soviet elections where the other party is stronger, so as to make sure that the opposition vote was not split, with the Mensheviks emphasising the urban soviets, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries contesting the soviets in the rural collectives. RKP General Secretary Leon Trotsky did not appear concerned by this development in an interview with the Krasnaya Gazeta, stating that he had 'utmost faith in the loyalty of the Proletariat towards their emancipators'."
 soviet.4.o1:0 "A fascinating development"
 soviet.5.t:0 "Bolsheviks Stage Urban Large Urban Rallies"
 soviet.5.d:0 "Officially, the formation of the opposition coalition did not rattle the Russian Communist Party, but it appears that may not have been entirely true. In a sudden turn from the otherwise calm and secure Bolshevik campaign, the party rallied its urban membership and affiliated trade unions to stage large urban rallies throughout the cities of Russia, extolling the Bolshevik revolution and portraying themselves as the natural successors of Vladimir Lenin. Through gritted teeth, leading Bolsheviks like Rykov and Trotsky spoke side by side in cities across Russia, but other Bolsheviks did also make a splash. The city of Moscow was enraptured by Bolshevik radical Alexander Bogdanov, leader of the Proletkult movement, who outshone many of the more moderate Bolsheviks within the war-time capital. Also noteworthy was Alexander Shliapnikov, whose name was chanted across the RSFSR by trade unionists, even when other Bolsheviks took the stage. While certainly effective at rallying the Bolshevik base, these rallies also exemplified the divisions within the Russian Communist Party more than ever."
 soviet.5.o1:0 "Even when appearing united, the party cannot help but seem divided."
 soviet.6.t:0 "Farmers Protest Lack of Rural Democracy"
 soviet.6.d:0 "The election has once again revealed the underlying tensions of the contemporary Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, as the countryside has again and again felt left behind by the Soviet government in Narodnodar. With the model of Soviet Democracy practiced in the RSFSR, elections are held on the basis of the soviets, who have yet to really penetrate into rural areas. Soviets have been established in the agricultural collectives and the state farms, but as employment on one of these is required to form a soviet, most of the still numerous freeholders are effectively disenfranchised. In response to this, the rural regions of the RSFSR have seen massive protests by farmers, mostly freeholders but also a sizeable cohort of kolkhozniki. The Socialist-Revolutionaries have been quick to capitalise on this, calling for the establishment of Soviets of Freeholders, a proposal heartily endorsed by Martov. Despite these pledges, few farmers believe that the Socialist-Revolutionaries would be able to win, and fewer yet believe that they could enact them, causing the protests to have no end in sight."
 soviet.6.o1:0 "We will not budge for these anti-democratic elements."
 soviet.7.t:0 "1936 Elections for the All-Russian Congress of Soviets"
 soviet.7.d:0 "Following over a month of intense campaigning, the day of reckoning is at hand. As the soviets all over the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic are casting their votes for either the Russian Communist Party, the Social Democratic Labour Party or the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Already, debate is abuzz about who the next Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars will be: Will it be Alexei Rykov, Lenin's trusted deputy for over a decade, and widely considered the continuation candidate? Will it be Leon Trotsky, the boisterous revolutionary popular with the Bolshevik party membership, but spurned by many politicians as a red Napoleon in the making? Or maybe Alexander Shliapnikov, whose appeals to workers power have appealed greatly to Soviet trade unions? Perhaps even Alexander Bogdanov, whose views may be radical and to some even esoteric, but who has also managed to rile up Bolshevik supporters all across Russia? Or will it be the respected orator Julius Martov, whose alliance with the Socialist-Revolutionaries have helped him punch above his weight class repeatedly."
 soviet.7.o1:0 "Alexei Rykov is Reconfirmed"
 soviet.7.o2:0 "Leon Trotsky rallies the Bolshevik base"
 soviet.7.o3:0 "Shliapnikov and the Workers' Opposition win over the Urban Workers"
 soviet.7.o4:0 "The Proletkult whips the workers into a revolutionary fervour"

 soviet_news.1.t:0 "The Death of Lenin"
 soviet_news.1.d:0 "News from Soviet Russia have reached us, proclaiming that their revolutionary founder, Vladimir Lenin, has passed away. Having led the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic since 1917, Lenin has been a fixture of world politics for almost two decades, always extolling the virtues of Bolshevism. Multiple countries have already sent their condolences to the Soviet people, either brief and curt or long and extolling the virtues of the revolutionary leader. Now, the world waits with bated breath to see who shall replace this titan of history."
 soviet_news.1.o1:0 "Farewell our brother! You have walked with honour."
 soviet_news.1.o2:0 "A death long overdue..."
 soviet_news.1.o3:0 "A great man passes into history. Farewell Comrade Lenin!"
 soviet_news.1.o4:0 "He may have been flawed, but he is worthy of respect."
 soviet_news.1.o5:0 "The leader of the Bolsheviks is gone."
 soviet_news.2.t:0 "Alexei Rykov Elected Chairman"
 soviet_news.2.d:0 "In unsurprising news, Soviet Russia has elected former Deputy Chairman Alexei Rykov to the office of the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Widely expected to continue the line Lenin set out, it appears that Rykov could overcome the splits within the Russian Communist Party and attain a majority within the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, and with that secure power. Rykov has so far seemed to be conciliatory towards the rest of his party, extolling the need for unity like under Lenin."
 soviet_news.2.o1:0 "More of the same in Soviet Russia, it seems."
 soviet_news.2.o2:0 "The Reds seem more stable than we had expected"
 soviet_news.3.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Elected Chairman"
 soviet_news.3.d:0 "Following an intensely fought electoral campaign and presumably even more intense negotiations, the Russian Communist Party General Secretary Leon Trotsky has risen to become the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Formerly a military leader during the Russian Civil War, Trotsky ended up becoming a darling of the Communist Party, thanks to his zealous adherence to the Communist line, and his belief in the world revolution. Already, world leaders have responded to this election with concern, worried that Soviet support for revolutionary movements worldwide will only increase now."
 soviet_news.3.o1:0 "Can we expect Soviet Russia to remain peaceful?"
 soviet_news.3.o2:0 "We must be wary of Bolshevik aggression."
 soviet_news.4.t:0 "Alexander Shliapnikov Elected Chairman"
 soviet_news.4.d:0 "In an overwhelming victory across Soviet Russia's cities, the Bolshevik trade unionist Alexander Shliapnikov has been elected Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. A fervent advocate of soviet power, the newly inaugurated chairman is already expected to implement measures in order to strengthen the voice of the Russian working class, perhaps even overhaul the Soviet system entirely along more Syndicalist lines. Already, Shliapnikov has reached out to Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries alike, hoping to enlist their support for his grand reform programme."
 soviet_news.4.o1:0 "Quite a shift from old Lenin."
 soviet_news.4.o2:0 "They merely traded dictatorship for mob rule."
 soviet_news.5.t:0 "Alexander Bogdanov Elected Chairman"
 soviet_news.5.d:0 "In stunning news, Bolshevik radical Alexander Bogdanov managed to overcome all other segments of his party and was elected Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. In a fiery speech to his supporters from his stronghold in Moscow, Chairman Bogdanov declared that a new revolution was at hand, a revolution of culture, meant to finally sweep away the vestiges of old, Tsarist society. Members and supporters of the Proletkult movement have already sprung into action, staging massive marches throughout Soviet Russia and according to some, even lighting old Churches on fire. It is safe to say that things are changing in Soviet Russia, the question just becomes whether this is for the better."
 soviet_news.5.o1:0 "Will this 'Cultural Revolution' herald a new Red Terror?"
 soviet_news.5.o2:0 "The revolution like Saturn devours its own people"
 soviet_news.6.t:0 "Julius Martov Elected Chairman"
 soviet_news.6.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the victors of the Soviet Russian election were not the Bolsheviks, but the recently forged alliance between the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Although winning on the slimmest of margins thanks to the Bolsheviks retaining widespread support among the urban soviets, the divisions within the Russian Communist Party could not be contained, and at the end of the day, Martov could boast of the most votes within the Congress of Soviets. Heralding reform in Soviet Russia, Martov has not just energised his own country, but also world society, who hope that Martov will prove to be easier to work with than Lenin did."
 soviet_news.6.o1:0 "A peaceful transition of power, that's all we could ask for."
 soviet_news.6.o2:0 "Yet more proof that the SRs are not to be trusted."
