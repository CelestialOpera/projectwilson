 #HUN_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "After the Great War Hungary was left in pieces and was surrounded by civil strife from Socialists and Conservative and Nationalists forces. As the 20's went along Hungary struggled and kept finding itself in worse and worse economic situations that seemed to only get worse and worse; and as the issues grew so did the radicalism. No one thought it could get worse, until 1929. When the New York Stock Crash happened, the economies of the world had collapsed and the worsening economy of Hungary had doubled the size of its crisis. In 1930, the Hungarian Communist Party and militants within staged an attempted coup in Budapest and seized the city for 13 days in what was called the Budapest Soviet Republic. The Coup eventually failed when a counter-coup by the Arrow Legions stormed in and put Gyula Gömbös in power."
 HUN_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "After the Great War Hungary was left divided and in political turmoil between Socialists, Conservatives, and Nationalists; slowly over time the economy worsoned and worsoned until the 1929 Stock Market Crash that plunged Hungary into absolute economic desolation. Following various revolts throughout 1930, finally a coup in 1931 by the Arrow Legions installed Gyula Gömbös to return Hungary to stability. The new National-Unitarist Government has proven successful in bringing the Hungarian Economy back and fixing many issues of poverty."

 ###Hungarian Events
 hungary.1.t:0 "Gömbös Succumbs To Fate"
 hungary.1.d:0 "Our great leader and bringer of the National Revolution, Gyula Gömbös has succumbed to fate, as testicular cancer has won the battle. Gömbös' battle with the disease was a private one that he kept behind closed doors with even some of his closest advisors being left in the dark, leaving the news of his death as a shock to the people and government. While many certainly noticed the more frail symptoms Gyula had been facing, many assumed it had in part been too stress and not cancer from his long and hard job.\n\nWith the news coming as a surprise to many within the government, close advisor to Gyula Gömbös, László Endre has assumed leadership of the great Magyar Nation. Endre, believed by many to be the key policy maker behind Gömbös is clearly in place to follow a strict line of following the leadership before him. Not everyone however is falling in line behind the new leader, Pál Prónay and his Magyar Revivalists as well as the National Socialists lead by Ferenc Szálasi have made moves in the National Magyar Congress to establish new leadership in the Nation."

 hungary.2.t:0 "National Magyar Congress Meets"
 hungary.2.d:0 "The National Magyar Congress established in 1934 by Gyula Gömbös as a replacement to the decedant parliament before it has been called today to meet to review the leadership of the state. After being spurred on by the two smaller factions of the government, László Endre had no choice but to call a meeting to avoid chaos within the state. The two main opponenets to Endre are Pál Prónay and Ferenc Szálasi, two prominent members of the government due to their leadership of factions opposed to the mainline established by Gyula Gömbös.\nPál Prónay and his Magyar Revivalists as they have grown due adopt the name advocate for a return to old Magyar ways and heavy adoption of Turanic values. Prónay has been known for his poetic views towards the Ancient Magyars as well as his love for the mighty steed. While still a strong proponenet of Catholicism he has advocated for a synthesis between Catholicism and old Magyar spiritual traditions. His most radical idea however is a supposed decentralizatin of Magyar society into a more tribal based grouping.\nWhile The Magyar Revivalists are considered the most radical of the three main factions, Ferenc Szálasi leads what to many is considered the most radical in the other direction. While not left wing in any way shape or form, the National Socialists form the left wing of the party with strong advocacy of workers and farmers rights, and unionization. Szálasi has called for a Anti-Bolshevik Socialism, a Hungarian Socialism that emphasises the Hungarian people in their quest for liberation. The National Socialists have openly opposed the strong Economic Unitarist measures of the Gömbös regime, claiming they aren't Unitarist but instead disguised capitalism in what has been declared the most open insult to Gyula Gömbös yet.\nMany wait to see where the Congress goes with their decision but it is accept that no matter who comes out on top changes will become apparent in Hungary."
