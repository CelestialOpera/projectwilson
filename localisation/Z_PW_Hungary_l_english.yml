 #HUN_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "After the Great War Hungary was left in pieces and was surrounded by civil strife from Socialists and Conservative and Nationalists forces. As the 20's went along Hungary struggled and kept finding itself in worse and worse economic situations that seemed to only get worse and worse; and as the issues grew so did the radicalism. No one thought it could get worse, until 1929. When the New York Stock Crash happened, the economies of the world had collapsed and the worsening economy of Hungary had doubled the size of its crisis. In 1930, the Hungarian Communist Party and militants within staged an attempted coup in Budapest and seized the city for 13 days in what was called the Budapest Soviet Republic. The Coup eventually failed when a counter-coup by the Arrow Legions stormed in and put Gyula Gömbös in power."
 #Needs Rewriting#HUN_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "After the Great War Hungary was left divided and in political turmoil between Socialists, Conservatives, and Nationalists; slowly over time the economy worsoned and worsoned until the 1929 Stock Market Crash that plunged Hungary into absolute economic desolation. Following various revolts throughout 1930, finally a coup in 1931 by the Arrow Legions installed Gyula Gömbös to return Hungary to stability. The new National-Unitarist Government has proven successful in bringing the Hungarian Economy back and fixing many issues of poverty."
