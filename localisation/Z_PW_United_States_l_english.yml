 USA_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "The Great War left America seen as a major power having more or less dictated the outcome of the War, but as the 20s went on America slowly dipped back into more diplomatic isolation. Working with the League of Nations they created while also ensuring that they don't get too involved in world affairs once again. Come 1929 things looked good until the Stock market Crash in New York nearly destroyed the world economy, especially the United States. President Reed had promised reform without sacrifice of American ideas to socialism but unfortunately his little reforms were too little too late, leaving many angry."
