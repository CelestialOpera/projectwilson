 USA_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "The Great War left America seen as a major power having more or less dictated the outcome of the War, but as the 20s went on America slowly dipped back into more diplomatic isolation. Working with the League of Nations they created while also ensuring that they don't get too involved in world affairs once again. Come 1929 things looked good until the Stock market Crash in New York nearly destroyed the world economy, especially the United States. President Reed had promised reform without sacrifice of American ideas to socialism but unfortunately his little reforms were too little too late, leaving many angry."

 unitedstates.1.d:0 "Tragic news from Manila as High Commissioner Frank Murphy has been assassinated by a Japanese National. Ike Ienobu, was quickly apprehended at the scene with a Type 26 Revolver and 3 bullets missing from the gun, 1 of which could not be found. Ike Ienobu also had a Japanese Passport, a cyanide capsule which he did not try to use, a map of Manila, and a letter from the Home Ministry connecting Ienobu to the Japanese Government. This attack on an American is unacceptable and will not go unpunished, as the President's adivsors begin to draft a proper declaration of war and wait for approval from Congress. Approval is expected to be passed unanimously and the military top brass has already begun preparations.\n\nAfter questioning and what has been promised as a completely ethical interogation, Ike Ienobu confessed to being a member of the Home Ministry and being asked to assassiate the High Commissioner to destabilize actions in the Philippines to help throw off American presence in the island nation. The President gave a speech to an emergency joint session of Congress where he proclaimed America will not bow down to external threats attempting to undermine American Democracy and with a loud wave of applause announced war was in America's own pond."

 unitedstates.2.d:0 "Tragic news from Honolulu as former High Commissioner of the Philippines and now Governor of Hawaii, Frank Murphy has been assassinated by a Japanese National. Ike Ienobu, was quickly apprehended at the scene with a Type 26 Revolver and 3 bullets missing from the gun, 1 of which could not be found. Ike Ienobu also had a Japanese Passport, a cyanide capsule which he did not try to use, a map of Honolulu, and a letter from the Home Ministry connecting Ienobu to the Japanese Government.

Approval is expected to be passed unanimously and the military top brass has already begun preparations.\n\nAfter questioning and what has been promised as a completely ethical interogation, Ike Ienobu confessed to being a member of the Home Ministry and being asked to assassiate the Governor who since the loss of the Philippines from American control has advocated for a more heavy American military presence in the Pacific. The President gave a speech to an emergency joint session of Congress where he proclaimed America will not bow down to external threats attempting to undermine American Democracy and with a loud wave of applause announced war was in America's own pond."

 unitedstates.3.t:0 "Labor-Republican Fusion Ticket"
 unitedstates.3.d:0 "In retaliation to the rising economic struggle from the Stock Crash in 1929 to which President Reed campaigned on fixing and has yet to do anything about it. James Reed's 1932 presidential campaign was based around fixing the American economy and issues stemming from the crash without sacrificing American Values to foreign Socialism. James Reed has done next to nothing for the American economy passing limited bills that would ultimately serve no one in its limited reach which has only allowed for the American people to grow more poor, hungry, and radical. The turn to the left in the general American populace has helped the rising Labor Party which formed in the early 1920s under Robert M. La Follette and progressive politicians who have opted to embrace an American Labor Economy, this popular rise allowed for the Labor Party to go from 2 seats to 37 in 1934 which while being a small percentage is an amazing showing for a third party. The rising popularity of the Labor Party, and anger towards James Reed's \"American Values" has lead the Republicans to look for options to sack the sitting President in the upcoming election and a movement within the party lead by progressive member Henry Wallace to \"Draft Senator Borah For Labor Unity" a movement that in the last month and a half has taken off even among some more liberal minded moderate Republicans. The draft movement luckily proved successful for the progressives and the Labor Party as the two parties came together with an announcement to nominate a single ticket in opposition to James Reed at the 1936 GOP National Convention. The convention seemed to be a landslide approval for William Borah who has been nominated to candidacy from both parties while they put forward Labor Party member Burton K. Wheeler, a former Democrat turned Progressive Laborist as running mate.\n\nWhile approval for the fusion ticket is strong among Republican and Labor Party voters, some right wing GOP leaders such as Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover, and Charles E. Hughes however, have decried this fusion ticket and coalition as the wrong turn but will support the Republican nominee nonetheless. A divide has been shown within the GOP from this, but the divide is yet to be anything serious and in even bigger news it was revealed at the convention that the two parties would be cooperating more than just in Presidential Ticket but in congress as well to back progressive legislation under which Wallace and Borah labeled \"The American Deal". While this is all certainly exciting, it is bringing worry to some Democrats, some who have even decried this as a Socialist Plot to intercept American democracy."

 unitedstates.4.t:0 "1936 Presidential Election"
 unitedstates.4.d:0 "It is time, the election is here and a tense one it has been with heavy campaigning on both sides. James Reed, the incumbent President has campaigned heavily on protecting America from Socialism and foreign take over, claiming Borah is the bringer of both while also promising to bring about new reforms to take a stronger stance against the economic downfalls of America while not pushing as radical as the Borah campaign.\n\"Too Little To Late" Borah campaigned on in retaliation to the Reed campaign, a slogan many have come to embrace as they feel the President is just making these promises to appease angry Americans. While many expected a for sure Borah sweep of the election, it turned out that many people in support of Reed have come out showing their support for true American beliefs but many Democratic elite worry that even this new momentum won't be enough to bring about a second victory for the Democrats in the election.\n\nThe Borah Campaign unlike the Reed campaign wasn't based on trying to seem apologetic and patriotic at the same time but instead was based on keeping momentum high, and the people riled up. Borah campaigned heavily in a charismatic populist light with backing from many, skeptical Business Republicans to passionate Laborists. Head of the Borah Campaign was Henry Wallace, who worked heavily on appeal to all, even making comparisons between Borah and old populist progressive William J. Bryan to win over skeptical Democrats. All in all, this election is showing to be tense, but as the ballots get counted, people prepare to hear the results come morning."
