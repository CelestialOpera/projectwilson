 RUS_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction. The Russian Revolution saw most anti-Bolshevik forces coalesce around the Whites, whose domain stretches from the Black Sea to Kamchatka. Outwardsly unified under Supreme Ruler Alexander Kolchak, the Russian State is fraught with infighting, as government factions vie to secure absolute power. Although Kolchak has certainly been a unifying figure, his attempts at industrialisation have all been abject failures, and discontent simmers among the minorities. Disgruntlement towards the Supreme Ruler is growing, and the knives may likewise be coming for him sooner than he anticipates."
