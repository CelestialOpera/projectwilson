 #Events
 denmark.1.t:0 "Chairman Christensen Assassinated"
 denmark.1.d:0 "Shots rang out in the streets of Copenhagen today. As Chairman Christian Eli Christensen was leaving home, a car pulled up on the street in front of his house and its passengers opened up on the Chairman, riddling his body with bullets. Chairman Christensen was dead before he hit the ground, and the car took off again before the police could respond. An emergency meeting was quickly called in the National Executive Committee of the Association of the Labour Movement, locking the capital city down completely. Taking up the Chairmanship is the former Deputy Chairman Aksel Larsen, who is regarded as a pro-Soviet reformer, although he will still need to have his position confirmed in the People's Thing when the crisis is over. The identity of the assassins is currently unknown, although police and Home Guard units are trawling the capital up and down in hopes of tracking them down. However, preliminary findings paint a very uncomfortable picture, as only the army has access to weapons of that calibre..."
 denmark.1.o1:0 "We must be on the guard"
 denmark.2.t:0 "Mobilise the Home Guard?"
 denmark.2.d:0 "As the investigation into the murder of Chairman Christensen continues, great concern have spread throughout Danish society. Multiple union sections report worries that the murder of Christensen was only the beginning, and already some workers are forming militias in an attempt to ward off any reactionary incursions. Theories are spreading through Danish society like a wildfire about who the perpetrators are, were it the Swedes, or the underground Conservatives? Hidden to the general public, however, the investigation has uncovered more gravely concerning evidence, as the inventory of Svanemøllen Barracks is currently missing multiple machine guns and several boxes of ammunition. General William Wain Prior has sworn acting Chairman Larsen that the army had nothing with the assassination to do, but many in the National Executive Committee are calling for the Home Guard to be mobilised, as not even Prior can dissuade the government of the notion that an army plot is a foolish notion."
 denmark.2.o1:0 "The Home Guard are more politically reliable"
 denmark.2.o2:0 "The army remains loyal and can be trusted"
 denmark.3.t:0 "Military Coup Averted"
 denmark.3.d:0 "The decision to mobilise the Home Guard appears to have been the right one, as in the early hours of the morning, multiple army units streamed out of the barracks and attempted to occupy Christiansborg, the House of Labour and other important sites throughout Copenhagen. They were, however, met by the mobilised members of the Home Guard, who struck back and prevented the army from securing control, evacuating the government in the meanwhile. Time quickly ran out for the army, as the people of Copenhagen were awoken by the commotion, and quickly rallied to the defense of the Workers' Republic, building barricades throughout the city to prevent any further army units from the coup. By 14, general William Wain Prior ordered the army to stand down, and the final holdouts of coupist forces had surrendered by late afternoon. Acting Chairman Larsen was quick to thank the Home Guard for their tireless defense of the revolution, and the people for aiding in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary plotters. The Home Guard has been quick to lock down other barracks across the country, with only little resistance. With that, after 16 years, the revolution is finally secure."
 denmark.3.o1:0 "The last gambit of the royalists have failed"
 denmark.4.t:0 "Elections for the Chairman of the People's Thing"
 denmark.4.d:0 "The storm has passed, and with that, the time has come for the People's Thing to elect a proper successor to Chairman Christian Christensen. To the surprise of few, this recent crisis has strengthened the position of acting chairman Aksel Larsen, who argues for a greater degree of state control over society in the vein of the Bolshevik government in Narodnodar, to prevent similar coups from ever happening again in the future. He is, however, being met with criticism from leading syndicalist Marie Nielsen, who argues that Larsen would set the Workers' Republic down the path of authoritarianism and dictatorship. Also the Social Democrat Hans Hedtoft has thrown his hat in the ring, arguing that future coups can only be prevented by undercutting the base of support of the reactionaries, advocating a 'revolutionary reconciliation' with the parts of society that feel left behind, such as the farmers of Jylland, although the presence of right-radicals such as Thorvald Stauning within his coalition make many worried about just what Hedtoft would bring into government. Finally, the anarchist Andreas Fritzner may not be a popular choice, but he has a dedicated following within the Association of the Labour Movement, and following that ordeal, Denmark may be ready to try something brand new."

 denmark.5.t:0 "The Danish Army Overthrows the Workers' Republic"
 denmark.5.d:0 "Trusting the army has become the downfall of Aksel Larsen and the entire Workers' Republic. The army units assigned to protecting key sites across the country, in a pre-planned motion, turned on the government of the Workers' Republic, arresting officials by the score. Larsen himself did not manage to escape, and was detained by a unit led by general William Wain Prior himself. In a swift strike, the army has now secured control over the country, and although resistance from workers militias and scattered Home Guard units is being put up, Prior does not expect to have much issue securing control. The Workers' Republic has been declared defunct, but the question just becomes what to do next. The 1915 Constitution could easily be restored under a Conservative government, but some in the army are accusing even that of having given the Syndicalists too much ground, and advocate restoring the King to power in full, without any trappings of 'democracy'."
