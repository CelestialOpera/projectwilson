 ENG_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom was hit hard from the Stock Crash of 29 but not nearly as bad as other nations but when many felt the Conservative Government of Stanley Baldwin was not doing enough and this saw a major electoral loss leading to a temporary Labour-Liberal coalition that lasted until 1935. Now in 1936, the Liberals rule by themselves with an economy still wrangling its way back, and a country looking towards the future as many fear war is once again on the horizon."
