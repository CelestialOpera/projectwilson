 ENG_PROJECT_WILSON_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom was hit hard from the Stock Crash of 29 but not nearly as bad as other nations but when many felt the Conservative Government of Stanley Baldwin was not doing enough and this saw a major electoral loss leading to a temporary Labour-Liberal coalition that lasted until 1935. Now in 1936, the Liberals rule by themselves with an economy still wrangling its way back, and a country looking towards the future as many fear war is once again on the horizon."

 britain.1.t:0 "Death of The King"
 britain.1.d:0 "The people have been made aware of tragic news today, as the King, His Majesty George V Of The United Kingdom and British Dominions, and Emperor of India has passed away. After years of declining health and now a nasty spout of Bronchitis, the King’s physician Lord Dawson made a decision to administer a lethal dose of Morphine and Cocaine. It is rumoured that the injection was approved by His Majesty’s wife, Queen-Consort Mary, and son, His Royal Highness, Prince Edward. The initial suggestion of the injection was seen as a shock and almost immediately shot down by the family but after Lord Dawson made his explanation of preserving the King’s Dignity and Image, it was accepted.\n\nNow with the passing of His Majesty King George, His Royal Highness Prince Edward has ascended to the throne as King; rumours have surrounded him with what many are calling a playboy lavish lifestyle, as well as rumours about him supporting a return to the King having a role in government and politics. Edward has not commented on the death of his father publically, nor has he said anything in public but it is expected he is to make his first public speech as King within the coming weeks. Many feel nervous to Edward’s ascendency to the throne after controversial statements he had made only months ago, statements about his favourability to the National Unity regime in Hungary. As the reign of Edward develops over the next few weeks, we will see if his reign will be embroiled in controversy or if we are all a bit paranoid."
 britain.1.o1:0 "May His Majesty Rest In Peace"
 britain.2.t:0 "Edward’s Speech"
 britain.2.d:0 "Finally after the unfortunate death of His Majesty George V, newly ascended King, His Majesty King Edward the Eighth addressed the nation from Buckingham Palace. The King gave a speech emphasizing the importance of British parliamentarism, Strength, Faith, and Nationalism.\n\n\“...my role as King is to guide Britain, a strong nation of strong people who never fail to show resilience. While I act as a guide to the wonderful and loyal subjects of the crown, I will be sure to never fail our great nation, our great system, our great Empire!”\n\nA quote that would be painted as being Anti-Democratic and a declaration of bad intent as Labour leader J. R. Clynes labeled it. Clynes, since the partying of King Edward had become more apparent as time went on, became strongly opposed to Edward as King, claiming it would cause the government to go bankrupt. Tory leader Stanley Baldwin also expressed concerns over a dark future for the monarchy, while expressing concern over the partying that Edward has become known for as well as concern over being unmarried. Prime Minister Herbert Samuel however has remained silent on the topic, which some believe is due to the Prime Minister wanting to wait to meet with the King properly."
 britain.2.o1:0 "Where Will Things Go"
 britain.3.t:0 "The King’s Date"
 britain.3.d:0 "King Edward only a few evenings ago was spotted with former flame Wallis Simpson at Windsor Castle where the American two time divorcee was seen clinging onto the King’s arm outside of the palace. News that has come as a shock after their very public break up two years prior when Edward had a relapsed affair with Lady Furness. Numerous people have put forward disapproval over their relationship, including the leaders of both the Tories and Labour Party, and Prime Minister Herbert Samuel. It seems however that very few among the general populace hold a strong animosity towards the couple. As things continue to develop for the new King, people wonder what the future of Britain will look like."
 britain.3.o1:0 "Is All Fair In Love?"
 britain.4.t:0 "The Prime Minister Speaks Out"
 britain.4.d:0 "Today while addressing Parliament, Prime Minister Herbert Samuel with support from not only a majority of his own party, but also the Tories, Labour, and the parties’ leaders gave a speech concerning the King’s new relationship. The parliamentary leaders have expressed frustration over the relationship, stating the fragility of the relationship’s past and the past divorces of Mrs Simpson put them into fear that the monarchy will hold stable as time goes on. The Prime Minister pointed out that within the framework of the Church of England, it is not right for a divorcee to remarry with their ex-spouse still alive and therefore it would be morally wrong and illegal for Edward to marry Wallis Simpson. In agreement, the three main leaders put forward an announcement stating if a marriage were to take place between His Majesty, King Edward and Mrs Wallis Simpson, they would be forced to resign due to moral obligation. While loud applause was heard throughout the House chambers, recently re-elected Liberal David Lloyd George as well as Tory minister Winston Churchill both voiced support for the King.\n\nThe Technocratic Party issued a joint statement in support of the King, strange considering the common anti-monarchist sentiment from within the party. Technocratic leader, James L. Battersby led the statements from the party.\n\nMany are worried about what is happening in the government, some have claimed it's an attempt to push out the King against his will while others are claiming it's the needed steps towards preserving British Democracy and Rule of Law. Many are right to be worried."

 britain.5.t:0 "King Edward Announces His Love"
 britain.5.d:0 "His Majesty King Edward has addressed the nation today in a confession of love for Mrs Wallis Simpson. Edward in his speech asked for the country and government to accept his love, and stand by his choice. The King seemingly is beginning to feel the pressure put on by the government, and is not taking it well. Following the announcement, the government put forward a statement demanding either abdication or breaking off the relationship, the most direct and authoritative statement the government has put out on the matter yet."
 britain.5.o1:0 "Does Love Matter?"
 britain.6.t:0 "Edward Proposes, Parliament Demands"
 britain.6.d:0 "It seems the crisis over the King’s romantic life has reached a boiling point after His Majesty announced the proposal and engagement between himself and Mrs Wallis Simpson. The Parliament has made a final demand to the King, with the threat of multiple government resignations which could throw the government and country into chaos. Tory leader Stanley Baldwin commented,\n\“The King in his first speech declared he was a nationalist of the British people, yet he is now willing to throw them into chaos over a woman?”\nA statement that would be countered by Pro-Edward parliamentarians such as Edward Grigg, and Winston Churchill, the former who said in retaliation,\n\“Baldwin lies about his majesty, pinning the blame of his own actions as he cozy’s up with the Liberals and Labour party on the King”\nDebates on the subject grew ferociously, until the doors to the House of Commons chambers had a loud knock. When the doors were opened, King Edward was standing in the threshold and walked through and the chambers went dead silent. Edward to the centre of the room as he prepared to give his announcement. In the moment thoughts raced through the heads of everyone, Pro-Abdication ministers and Pro-Edward ministers alike as the tense moment passed."
 britain.6.o1:0 "I have made an impossible decision."
 britain.6.o2:0 "I am the King, Wallis will be my Queen"
 britain.7.t:0 "Government Leaders Resign"
 britain.7.d:0 "Following the announcement of His Majesty refusing to step down and ensuring the government he will continue as King while also marrying Wallis Simpson, as the parliament erupted into arguments, the speaker finally brought order to the Chambers and a string of resignations followed. The Prime Minister, Tory leader, Labour leader, and various other ministers announced they will resign with immediate effect leaving the number of full seats in parliament to nearly only half. Leading to the King dissolving parliament and calling for fresh elections in a matter of a day.\n\nAfter these expected mass resignations, the King met with various sitting parliamentarians who agreed to form a caretaker government until the elections arrived, the government formed under liberal MP David Lloyd George as Prime Minister, the new Prime Minister and King together addressed the nation with promises of strength and unity. The most notable part of the caretaker government was the 3 sitting Technocrats who have made it clear that they view the resignations as a great treason. On the side of the aisle however, rumours of a large left wing movement organized by Stafford Crips to stand in the election in opposition to the King."

 britain.8.t:0 "Technocracy Rally In London"
 britain.8.d:0 "In London only a few days ago the leader of the Technocrats James L. Battersby led a rally in London. The rally in favor of their political platform as well as protecting the sovereignty of the monarch saw a massive audience never seen at a rally before for the Technocrats. With the economic stand still the country has been in on top of the crisis with the King, many have turned to more radical groups with the Technocracy Party and Communists both announcing increased membership.\n\nThe popularity surge of the technocrats, and mass division between the Liberals and Tories internally are making it seem as if the Technocracy Party may very well have a high chance of winning this hot election soon to come."
 britain.8.o1:0 "An Age of Technology?"
 britain.9.t:0 "Stafford Cripps Forms United Front"
 britain.9.d:0 "Stafford Cripps, a member of the left wing of the Labour Party announced today only 14 days before the election is to take place, a United Front against the growing authoritarian Far-Right that is seemingly taking over British Politics. The Labour Party, Independent Labour, the communists, and even some sections of more left leaning Liberals have all grouped together on the United Front banner for the upcoming election. The Conservative Party and Liberals have vowed to stay apart from the United Front but will be coming up with strategies to ensure that they don’t cause the Technocrats which have been surging in popularity after their stance on the King, to come to power, an outcome many are fearing to become more and more likely.\n\nOne benefit the United Front will have is their promise to bring real change that the government’s of the past have promised for 6 years with no change in sight. The country has been in an economic rut since the Stock Crash in 1929 and limited success has been seen, a thing that Cripps has promised to rectify once the threat on our democracy has been dealt with.\n\nWith two groups forming on the forefront of British electoral politics, some within the media have begun to label the election as the Election of Radicalism."
 britain.9.o1:0 "An Age of The Workers?"
 britain.10.t:0 "Election of Radicals"
 britain.10.d:0 "The election has come and many have been on the frontlines at the ballot boxes ensuring the other side doesn’t try to interfere with intimidation or ballot burning, it seems like one of the largest turnouts in British electoral history with people on edge. The Conservative Party leader Stanley Baldwin saw the party completely split when he resigned along with fellow higher ups in opposition to the King’s engagement. Edward Grigg became the parliamentary leader of the Tories working alongside the various other members of the Pro-Edward custodial government, causing the already growing rift in the conservative party to cave in completely. This collapse in the Tory party has left numerous seats being contested by multiple people both from the Conservative Party and it isn’t only the Tories experiencing this, the former ruling Liberals have also seen a rift in their party albeit not as large as the Tories. These rifts in the two parties, has made room for the unexpected, two radical groups clawing for the house.\n\nThe United Front, organized by more radical elements of the Labour Party but including the entirety of the party, Independent Labour, and the Communists under one unified ticket. Stafford Cripps, the leader of the United Front has put forward many ideas but most importantly the proposal of a referendum on the status and power of the monarchy, as well as massive economic reforms to stabilize the faltering economy. The United Front however, is not the only major force.\n\nThe Technocracy Party lead by James L Battersby has won over numerous voters with their radical, populist, and self declared progressive nationalistic agenda from both sides. Battersby has promised to back the King in his romantic endeavors, to maintain British Democracy, and to achieve significant reforms to the British economic system in favor of the Technocratic agenda. Liberals, Conservatives, Monarchists, Nationalists, and more have all flocked to the Technocrats as a form of stability and opposition to communism while the two parties that have done so before have collapsed.\n\nMany are on edge, many are in the streets, and many are at the ballot box as the day goes by hoping for a miracle for their own side. In only a short few hours, we will see who will be the ones to shape this new age for Britain."
 britain.10.o1:0 "Victory For Technocracy!"
 britain.10.o2:0 "The United Front Pushes Forward!"
 britain.11.t:0 "A Romantic Abdication"
 britain.11.d:0 "Applause rang in the House chambers as the King made his announcement that he will abdicate in favor of his new fiance from all members, even those opposed to the movement calling for his abdication. Edward Grigg put forward a statement saying that while he opposes the abdication and sees it as a way to trample love for political power, he said he respected the King’s decision to give up power for love.\n\nLater the same day, around 5:00 PM, the King began to make a speech over broadcast, saying how it was a tremendously hard decision to make. He also added how he would find it impossible to rule without the love of his fiance, and if he must give up the ability to rule for that love then it is better than not having it at all. In the speech, Edward also brought forward his brother Albert, and announced that with his abdication that Prince Albert would become the King of Great Britain, and The Emperor of India.\n\nHis speech ended with him signing the papers officializing his abdication, with his brothers signing as witnesses. While it could be considered a sad day in Britain, some feel that the winds blowing through the nation are not the winds of sadness and defeat, but of love, and stability."
